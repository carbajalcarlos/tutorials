web01	cc	08/05/2018	web	"Opposition politician Nikol Pashinyan spearheaded weeks of protests in Armenia that brought an end to 10 years of rule by Serzh Sargsyan.
Now he has persuaded a parliament dominated by Mr Sargsyan's own party to back him as prime minister, only a week after he lost an initial vote.
After MPs voted again on Tuesday, thousands of supporters cheered in Republic Square in the capital Yerevan.
Rock star Serj Tankian of the band System of a Down earlier joined crowds.
Mr Pashinyan, who led what has become known as Armenia's ""Velvet Revolution"", promised MPs that human rights would be protected, and that corruption and election-rigging would end. 
""All people are equal before the law. There will be no people enjoying privileges in Armenia. That's it. Full stop,"" he said.
Why does this matter?
A landlocked nation of 2.9 million people, Armenia is dependent on Russia for its security and has a Russian military base on its territory.
Armenia's peaceful uprising against single-party rule - and the way its political leaders responded - is seen as unprecedented for a former Soviet state. Russia has not intervened in the recent political events and Mr Pashinyan told MPs that relations with Moscow would be a priority, particularly military co-operation.
Why Armenia's 'Velvet Revolution' won without a bullet fired
