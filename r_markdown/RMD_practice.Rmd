## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Loading, include = FALSE}
# Loading required libraries
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
library(knitr, quietly = TRUE)
 

# Loading required data
edidiv <- read.csv("D:/code/r/tutorials/r_markdown/edidiv.csv")

#As before, we are going to construct a table of how many species occur in each taxonomic group
#But in a much less verbose way
richness <- 
  edidiv %>%
    group_by(taxonGroup) %>%
    summarise(Species_richness = n_distinct(taxonName))
```

### This is the result of a miystery
```{r Summary, echo = FALSE}
kable(richness)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Barplot, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE, dev = 'svg'}
barplot(richness$Species_richness, 
        names.arg = richness$taxonGroup, 
        xlab="Taxa", ylab="Number of species", 
        ylim=c(0,600)
        ) 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Ploting dataframes
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Create a barplot

#This time we also want to find the most common species in each taxonomic group
max_abund <-
  edidiv %>%
    group_by(taxonGroup) %>%
    summarise(taxonName = names(which.max(table(taxonName))))

#Join the two data frames together, using "taxonGroup" as the reference
richness_abund <-
inner_join(richness, max_abund, by = "taxonGroup")
richness_abund <- rename(richness_abund, Most_abundant =  taxonName, Taxon = taxonGroup)

#What does the data frame look like now?
kable(richness_abund)
```
